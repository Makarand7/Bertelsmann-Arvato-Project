# Customer Segmentation Report - POPULATION
elif section == "üó∫Ô∏è Customer Segmentation Report - POPULATION":
    st.markdown("""
<h2 style="color:#a770a0; text-align:left;">üó∫Ô∏è Customer Segmentation Final Report for General Population (AZDIAS)</h2>

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Objective  
This report presents the findings from the segmentation analysis of the AZDIAS dataset, which contains demographic and lifestyle data representing the general population of Germany. The analysis employed unsupervised learning techniques to identify clusters of individuals with similar attributes, providing actionable insights for targeted marketing.  

<hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc;">  

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Overview  
The AZDIAS dataset underwent extensive preprocessing, including:  

‚úî **Scaling and imputing missing values**  
‚úî **Application of PCA** to reduce dimensions while preserving 95% of the variance  
‚úî **Post-PCA Data Shape:** The reduced dataset contained over **890,000 records** with significantly fewer features, enhancing computational efficiency and interpretability  

<hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc;">  

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Methodology and Key Steps  

### ‚û°Ô∏è 3.1 Dimensionality Reduction  
PCA was used to retain essential information and eliminate redundancy in the dataset. This step ensured efficient clustering of the data.  

### ‚û°Ô∏è 3.2 Optimal Clustering  
The optimal number of clusters was determined using the **Elbow Method**, where the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) was plotted against the number of clusters. The "elbow" observed at **4 clusters** indicated the most suitable balance between complexity and interpretability.  

### ‚û°Ô∏è 3.3 KMeans Clustering  
Using **KMeans with 4 clusters**, individuals were grouped into distinct segments that share common demographic and lifestyle characteristics.  

<hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc;">  

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Findings from Clustering Analysis  
The general population was categorized into **4 key clusters**, described below:  

- **Cluster 0:**  
   - ‚úî **Size:** Largest group  
   - ‚úî **Demographics:** Dominated by middle-aged individuals  
   - ‚úî **Key Features:** Strong inclination towards stability in residence duration  

- **Cluster 1:**  
   - ‚úî **Size:** Medium-sized segment  
   - ‚úî **Demographics:** Younger demographic, active in urban settings  
   - ‚úî **Distinct Traits:** Interest in modern, technology-driven products  

- **Cluster 2:**  
   - ‚úî **Size:** Smaller cluster  
   - ‚úî **Key Behaviors:** Strong alignment with traditional values  
   - ‚úî **Key Insights:** Higher representation in rural or suburban areas  

- **Cluster 3:**  
   - ‚úî **Size:** Smallest cluster  
   - ‚úî **Behavior:** High diversity in purchasing preferences, from luxury to budget-conscious items  

<hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc;">  

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Business Implications  
The segmentation insights from the general population can support business strategies as follows:  

- üéØ **Personalized Outreach:** Design marketing campaigns tailored to the needs and preferences of each cluster  
- üìà **Enhanced Customer Acquisition:** Focus resources on clusters more likely to convert into loyal customers  
- üåç **Market Penetration:** Develop region-specific strategies for clusters predominantly residing in particular geographic areas  

<hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc;">  

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Limitations and Recommendations  

- ‚ö† **Data Imputation:** Mean imputation for missing values may oversimplify the dataset and overlook subtle trends  
- ‚ö† **Clustering Assumptions:** The use of Euclidean distance in KMeans may not capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data  
- üîé **Further Exploration:** Incorporate additional clustering techniques, such as hierarchical clustering or DBSCAN, to validate and refine these results  

<hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc;">  

<p style="font-size:16px; color:#4a148c;"><strong>‚úÖ This segmentation provides a foundational understanding of Germany's general population and guides subsequent analyses, including predictive modeling.</strong></p>

# Customer Segmentation Report - CUSTOMERS
elif section == "üë• Customer Segmentation Report - CUSTOMERS":
    st.markdown("""
<h2 style="color:#a770a0; text-align:left;">üë• Customer Segmentation Final Report for Customer Data (CUSTOMERS)</h2>

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Objective  
The aim of this report is to summarize the findings from the customer segmentation analysis performed on the `df_customers` dataset. This analysis utilized clustering methods to identify distinct customer groups, leveraging unsupervised learning techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and KMeans clustering.  

<hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc;">  

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Overview  
The `df_customers` dataset includes attributes representing demographic and behavioral data of existing customers. After preprocessing, the dataset was scaled, imputed for missing values, and subjected to dimensionality reduction.  

‚úî **Post-PCA Data Shape:** The reduced dataset contained **191,652 samples** with **329 principal components**, preserving 95% of the variance.  

<hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc;">  

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Methodology and Key Steps  

### ‚û°Ô∏è 3.1 Dimensionality Reduction  
PCA was applied to reduce data dimensionality while retaining key patterns. This step addressed multicollinearity and improved computational efficiency.  

### ‚û°Ô∏è 3.2 Optimal Clustering  
The optimal number of clusters was determined using the **elbow method**, which plots within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) for various values of *k*.  

### ‚û°Ô∏è 3.3 KMeans Clustering  
The **KMeans algorithm** was employed to partition customers into distinct clusters. Each cluster represents a unique segment with shared characteristics.  

<hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc;">  

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Findings from Clustering Analysis  
The customer base was segmented into **4 primary clusters**, each described below:  

- **Cluster 0:**  
   - ‚úî **Size:** Largest cluster  
   - ‚úî **Demographics:** Predominantly older age groups  
   - ‚úî **Key Features:** High variance in `LNR` and stability in `WOHNDAUER` (residence duration)  

- **Cluster 1:**  
   - ‚úî **Size:** Moderate-sized segment  
   - ‚úî **Demographics:** Diverse age distribution with higher income stability  
   - ‚úî **Distinct Traits:** Consistently high representation of luxury buyers  

- **Cluster 2:**  
   - ‚úî **Size:** Medium-sized cluster  
   - ‚úî **Key Behaviors:** Active in purchasing insurance products  
   - ‚úî **Geographic Pattern:** Predominantly Western Germany (`OST_WEST_KZ` = 'W')  

- **Cluster 3:**  
   - ‚úî **Size:** Smallest group  
   - ‚úî **Behavior:** Limited purchase activity but notable for unique niche product interests  

<hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc;">  

### ‚úÖ Key Categorical Insights Across Clusters  
- Variables such as **`CAMEO_DEU_2015`** (socioeconomic classification) and **`D19_LETZTER_KAUF_BRANCHE`** (last purchase category) played a significant role in differentiating clusters.  

<hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc;">  

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Business Implications  
This segmentation provides actionable insights for marketing strategies:  

- üéØ **Targeted Campaigns:** Design cluster-specific marketing strategies to cater to the unique preferences and purchasing behaviors  
- üìä **Resource Allocation:** Allocate resources efficiently to high-value clusters, such as those with higher income stability and active purchasing patterns  
- ü§ù **Customer Retention:** Use insights to enhance personalized experiences for the most loyal and lucrative customer segments  

<hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc;">  

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Limitations and Recommendations  

- ‚ö† **Data Limitations:** Missing data imputation may oversimplify real-world customer behaviors, potentially affecting the clustering outcome  
- ‚ö† **Model Limitations:** KMeans' reliance on Euclidean distance may struggle with non-linear relationships. Exploring other clustering techniques like **DBSCAN** could yield additional insights  

<hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc;">  

<p style="font-size:16px; color:#4a148c;"><strong>‚úÖ This segmentation serves as a foundation for predictive modeling in subsequent phases, aiming to predict campaign responses and further optimize customer engagement.</strong></p>
